/*
FAN OUT
Multiple functions reading from the same channel until that channel is closed

FAN IN
A function can read from multiple unputs and proceed until all are closed by
multiplexing the input channels onto a single channel that's closed when
all the inputs are closed.

PATTERN
ther's a pattern to our pipeline functions:
-- stages close their outbound channels when all the send operations are done.
-- stages keep receiving values from inbound channels until those channels are closed.

/*
CHALLENGE #1
When know HOW to do fan out / fan in, but do we know WHY?
Why would we want to do fan out / fan in?

Fan out cause we have a lot of values to process and two workoers to process
